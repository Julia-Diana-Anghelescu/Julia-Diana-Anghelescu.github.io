          <div class="about-body text-dark-green">
            <p>
              I'm a UX designer with a background in fashion design, and my transition into the digital space has been shaped
              by a long-standing interest in clarity, thoughtful problem-solving, and understanding how people interact with 
              the world around them. In fashion, my work often revolved around translating ideas into precise specifications, 
              communicating across teams, and ensuring that each detail supported the larger vision. Those experiences taught 
              me the importance of being clear, dependable, and honest about what a design needs in order to succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              What ultimately drew me toward UX was a desire to explore human behavior more deeply. I became fascinated by the 
              points where users struggle, the moments when an interface quietly supports them, and the opportunities where a 
              system can be reshaped to feel more intuitive. I enjoy the challenge of untangling those experiences—looking 
              closely at what people need, understanding the logic behind their decisions, and turning that understanding into 
              meaningful interactions.
            </p>

            <p>
              My background makes me comfortable navigating complexity with a balance of structure and creativity. I approach 
              design with intention, guided by careful analysis but open to exploration and collaboration. Working closely with 
              developers, researchers, and stakeholders has reinforced how essential shared understanding is, and how the best 
              solutions often emerge from teams who communicate openly and build on each other's strengths.
            </p>

            <p>
              What motivates me most is designing experiences that feel connected—interfaces that anticipate users' intentions, 
              reduce friction, and make information approachable. Good design should feel effortless, and achieving that requires 
              attention, care, and a willingness to refine continuously. Each project challenges me to grow, to think more 
              critically, and to deepen my craft.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the past eight years, I've worked across multiple design disciplines, each one shaping how I think, work, and 
              collaborate. I hold a UX Design certificate from Concordia University and an undergraduate degree in Design (Fashion 
              with Honors) from TMU (formerly Ryerson). My journey has been defined by curiosity, steady growth, and a genuine 
              commitment to creating digital experiences that help people move through their tasks with clarity and confidence.

            I believe design should make complex things feel simple without oversimplifying them.
            My work is grounded in understanding how people think, what they need, and where they
            might get stuck. I aim for interfaces that reduce friction, communicate clearly, and
            respect users’ time, while still leaving room for personality and visual warmth.

            I’m currently completing a master’s degree with a focus on UX to strengthen the
            foundations that support better collaboration—especially around programming concepts
            and CSS, so discussions with developers are precise and productive. I’m also exploring
            AI in a mindful way: I create my own work first, then use AI to stress-test ideas,
            surface edge cases, and challenge my assumptions. Alongside this, I stay up to date
            with evolving tools like Figma and design systems, so my process, and the teams I work
            with, can take full advantage of new capabilities without losing clarity or control.
