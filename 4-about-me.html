                    <p>
                        I'm a UX designer with a background in fashion design, and my transition into
                        the digital space has been shaped by a long-standing interest in clarity,
                        thoughtful problem-solving, and understanding how people interact with the
                        world around them. In fashion, my work often revolved around translating ideas
                        into precise specifications, communicating across teams, and ensuring that
                        each detail supported the larger vision. Those experiences taught me the
                        importance of being clear, dependable, and honest about what a design needs
                        in order to succeed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What ultimately drew me toward UX was a desire to explore human behavior more
                        deeply. I became fascinated by the points where users struggle, the moments
                        when an interface quietly supports them, and the opportunities where a system
                        can be reshaped to feel more intuitive. I enjoy the challenge of untangling
                        those experiences—looking closely at what people need, understanding the
                        logic behind their decisions, and turning that understanding into meaningful
                        interactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My background makes me comfortable navigating complexity with a balance of
                        structure and creativity. I approach design with intention, guided by careful
                        analysis but open to exploration and collaboration. Working closely with
                        developers, researchers, and stakeholders has reinforced how essential shared
                        understanding is, and how the best solutions often emerge from teams who
                        communicate openly and build on each other's strengths.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What motivates me most is designing experiences that feel connected—interfaces
                        that anticipate users' intentions, reduce friction, and make information
                        approachable. Good design should feel effortless, and achieving that requires
                        attention, care, and a willingness to refine continuously. Each project
                        challenges me to grow, to think more critically, and to deepen my craft.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the past eight years, I've worked across multiple design disciplines,
                        each one shaping how I think, work, and collaborate. I hold a UX Design
                        certificate from Concordia University and an undergraduate degree in Design
                        (Fashion with Honors) from TMU (formerly Ryerson). My journey has been defined
                        by curiosity, steady growth, and a genuine commitment to creating digital
                        experiences that help people move through their tasks with clarity and
                        confidence.

                    <p>
                        I believe design should make complex things feel simple without oversimplifying them.
                        My work is grounded in understanding how people think, what they need, and where they might get stuck.
                        I aim for interfaces that reduce friction, communicate clearly, and respect users’ time, while still leaving
                        room for personality and visual warmth.

                    <p>
                        I’m currently completing a master’s degree with a focus on UX to strengthen the foundations that support better collaboration—especially around programming concepts and CSS, so discussions with developers are precise and productive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m also exploring AI in a mindful way: I create my own work first, then use AI to stress-test ideas, surface edge cases, and challenge my assumptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alongside this, I stay up to date with evolving tools like Figma and design systems, allowing my process—and the teams I work with—to take full advantage of new capabilities without losing clarity or control.
